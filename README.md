# superstore_analysis

## About this project

This project is about the amount of sales each superstore is making and which states they are benefitting the most from. I have used the product data and the order data to do this because the order data will tell me which region has ordered a certain number of product so I can then compare it to the product data since it will contain the price of the product which will allow me to see which state has ordered the most products and the state that the superstore is making the most profit from. The next reason I chose these two is because It will help identify the trends a lot easier which is going to help the supermarket expand and improve for the future since taking advantage of the trends will help bring in more customers. I will present this data on a map because the map on Tableau because the map will show each state that has ordered products and it will show the number of sales the supermarket has made in each state meaning that it will be very clear to understand which state makes the supermarket the most sales.
